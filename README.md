# Calculator

## Requirements

1. A deployed website (using GitHub Pages)
2. A public GitHub repository for your codebase
3. A README.md with a short intro to the project
4. At least 15 Git commits for the different stages in your development
5. Be responsive and built mobile-first, it should work on different screen widths
6. Accept a minimum of 2 inputs, perform an operation and show the output
7. DOES NOT USE THE eval() method (as this is extremely dangerous)
8. Code is highly readable (good naming and indented correctly)
